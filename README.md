## Interesting Article
Here’s something I found interesting:  
[The hardest part of building software is not coding, it's requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)

## Why I Like It

I found this interesting because it reinforces the idea that good communication,
clear specs, and adaptability are just as important as coding skills.  
It also made me think about how agile practices and continuous clarification
can help prevent wasted effort and late-discovered “bugs” that are 
really requirement gaps. 
- I agree with this paragraph and I think you make some great points about how it reinforces the idea that good communication is just as important as coding skills

The blog also points out that while AI tools (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) can already
help with **coding**, they still cannot handle **requirements**, since those are often
ambiguous and constantly changing. So we don’t need to worry too much about being replaced by AI anytime soon.
